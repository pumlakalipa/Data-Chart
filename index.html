      The New York City Real Estate market, alongside renters, has experienced a rollercoaster ride over the last three years. In 2019, rental fees were reported to have skyrocketed, with the median asking rent being at a record high. In 2020, as the global Coronavirus pandemic hit, the market plummeted as hundreds of thousands of renters made their way out of the city that became one of the world's COVID-19 epicenters. As a result, landlords introduced enticing incentives to fill vacant apartments in neighborhoods many dream of living in.

    <p>"An increase in supply led to rent reductions and concessions in the Upper West Side (UWS) during the pandemic," said Corcoran real estate broker and landlord Tiga McLoyd, as he explained why in-demand neighborhoods such as the UWS had low rental prices amid the pandemic. "It's just like anything else, you know, it's like if you've got too many sneakers in a sneaker store, then you gotta have a sale and clear some inventory."</p>

    <p>However, the sale didn't last long as the city began vaccine distribution. Schools reopened for in-person instruction, workers returned to their workplaces, and the housing market rebounded as people flocked back into formerly vacant in-demand neighborhoods.</p>

    <p>However, there are neighborhoods in Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn that have median asking rent fees that remain below pre-pandemic levels.</p>

    <p>Below is a line chart showing the percentage difference in median asking rent from 2019 to 2021. </p>
